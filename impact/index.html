                To fulfill my wellness requirment, I took IMPACT, a self-defense course. The class met twice a week, 
                one class for learning physical skills and one class for discussing the week's reading.

                Eeach week we read a chapter from Sexual Citizens, a book summarizing a study done on sexual 
                assaults on college campuses.

            <h2>Final Paper</h2>
            <p>
                Describing IMPACT as a self-defense class doesn't quite tell the whole story. Going 
                into the class, I expected it to focus a lot on technique and drills. Those topics are 
                covered, but what I didn't expect was the opt-in nature of the scenarios, the focus on 
                verbal deescalation, and the emphasis on breathing and knowing how to calm yourself down. 
                To be clear, all these things made it a better class. I went into this class expecting a 
                run-of-the-mill martial arts class, and what I got was an instruction in how to be 
                confident and comfortable in the space you occupy.

                A typical class starts with the instructor telling the students what skill they're 
                going to learn and a situation where you might use that skill. The instructor demos the 
                skill with one of the student instructors, who is wearing a large padded suit and a 
                helmet. (This suit was one of the funniest parts of the whole classâ€”imagine football 
                gear with two inches of foam covering every surface. Our instructor demonstrated how 
                she could kick one of the student instructors directly in the groin, and he wouldn't 
                feel a thing.) Then the students slowly learn the steps to the move. The first skill 
                we learned was the eye strike/knee to the groin combo. We learned how to position our 
                hand for the eyestrike, then the form for the knee to the groin, then we put it all 
                together slowly. After that, we did drills with the student instructors where we 
                practiced using the skill on them. Then we moved into scenarios, where the instructor 
                gives us a situation where we would have to use a self-defense skill. Each student 
                would act out the skill with a student instructor while the instructor coached them. 
                This sounded really frightening to me at first, but our instructor explained to us 
                that that's the goal. When you put yourself in an adrenalizing situation, you learn 
                how to properly manage that rush of fear. Nobody was forced to do a scenario, anyone 
                who felt uncomfortable could sit it out. The classes usually ended with breathing 
                exercises and a talk circle. Depending on how much time we had, we learned between 
                one to two skills each class.

                The eyestrike and knee to the groin were the two fundamental skills that we built on 
                through different scenarios. We learned how to defend yourself when grabbed from behind 
                (twist, slap the groin, elbow to the face, quarter turn and knee to the groin), how to 
                twist your wrist out of someone's hand (twist your wrist towards the opening and step 
                away), and how to defend yourself if someone grabs you while you're sleeping (wait for 
                an opening, eyestrike, then scootch-kicks on the ground). Most importantly, we also 
                learned verbal skills to deescalate a situation. A creepy guy in a train station is 
                not necessarily a physical threat to you, and if you assume that he is a physical 
                threat before he attacks you, then you've just started an unnecessary fight and put 
                yourself in a murky legal situation. Some of the scenarios we practiced included this 
                added uncertainty. We had to assess the situation and determine if we needed to 
                escalate to a physical altercation. Again, this wasn't karate, we weren't fighting for 
                the fun of it, the goal was alway to avoid a fight. I think these verbal skills were the 
                most important thing I learned in this class.

                What I will remember most about this class is the camaraderie that emerges between you 
                and your classmates. We clapped when a classmate finished a drill, and we cheered when 
                she landed a solid hit on the student instructor. I started this class as good friends 
                with some of my classmates and just acquaintances with others, but by the end I felt 
                closer to all of them.

            	To any junior taking this class, I'd say do it. I took this class because I am an anxious 
                person, and I wanted to feel more confident by knowing I had the skills to defend myself. 
                In this class, I learned not just how to defend myself, but also how to stand up for 
                myself. It may sound stupid, after all standing up for yourself is such a basic skill, 
                but it's something I've never had to do before. Knowing that I had the ability to get 
                loud, to refuse something I didn't want, that was the most helpful thing I learned.
