        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I have never taken a cermaics class at BB&N, but last year my free block lined up with my friends' ceramics class, so 
                I joined their class during my long block free on Fridays. During that time I experimented with creating small animal 
                sculptures, and I wanted to continue that project during my SSP.
            </p>
            <p>I finished eight pieces during SSP, but not all of them are out of the kiln yet. I'll show 
                my process on one piece, then show all the pieces at the end.
            </p>

            <h2>Sculpting</h2>
            <p>
                Here I form the basic shape out of wet clay, then wait for it to become leather-hard. Once 
                it's dry enough to work with, I begin sculpting.
            </p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <div class="image">

            <h2>Bisquing</h2>
            <p>
                After the piece is bone dry, it goes into the kiln for a bisque firing. It's very fragile 
                while bone dry, but after the bisque it becomes a lot more durable. The first image is before 
                firing, the second image is after firing.
            </p>

            <h2>Glazing</h2>
            <p>Glazing gives a ceramic piece a durable sheen. It also looks cool. The first image shows 
                the figurine with glaze painted on, before firing. The second shows it after coming out 
                of the kiln.
