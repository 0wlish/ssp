            <h1>Ham radio</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>For my new experience, I decided to get my ham radio license. Ham radio is a hobby that dates back to the early 1900s, when radio was first invented.
                 Before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established, there was no regulations on radio and the airwaves were 
                 filled with hobbyists experimenting with the new technology. When the FCC created the radio band use plan, they allocated space for amateur operators. 
                 Today, anyone can take an exam to become licensed to transmit on the ham radio bands. I have wanted to get my license for a while, and I thought that SSP 
                 would be the perfect time to do it. I studied for my test for the first part of SSP, and after I got my license, I began constructing a Yagi antenna.

            <h2>Homemade antenna</h2>
            <p>After getting my license, I got a Baofeng handheld radio. This radio was better than most 
                handhelds, but it still wasn't good. In order to improve the signals I was receiving and 
                transmitting, I decided to build a directional antenna.
            </p>
            <p>The thing about antennas is that anything can be one if you try hard enough. Well, maybe 
                not <em>anything</em>, but close enough. All I had to do to make a working antenna was 
                feed a coaxial cable to a length of conducting metal then point it in the sky. However, to 
                make a working antenna for a specific frequency, your antenna needs to be a certain length, 
                so it can resonate at that frequency. Things start to get complicated here.
            </p>
            <h2>Building the antenna</h2>

            </div>
            <p>To start off, I cut three pieces of zinc-plated steel threaded rods and one piece of pine wood. The wood 
                is going to function as the boom (where the elements will be mounted), the two shorter 
                rods will be the driven element, and the longer rod will be the reflector.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Here's the final assembly. After I had the antenna built, I had to find a way to attach the 
                coax. I chopped the end off of a coax cable I bought on amazon, the soldered ring terminals to 
                to the other end. I put the whole thing together to test it.

            </div>
            <p style="margin-left: 60%">Finally, I was ready to test it using an antenna analyzer. It's important 
                to have a low standing wave ratio (SWR) in any antenna. SWR measures how much of your signal is 
                being reflected back at your transmitter. Lower is better, 1.2 to 2 is ideal. With some help from the Boston Amateur 
                Radio Club, I tested it with their antenna analyzer...and found that it had an SWR of 10. Something 
                clearly wasn't working! We tested to make sure the cable was working, then I redid the ring terminals 
                and we shortened the elements of the antenna. After a little trial-and-error, I had a SWR of 2. Not bad!
