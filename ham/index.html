            <p>For my new experience, I decided to get my ham radio license. Ham radio is a hobby that dates back to the early 1900s, when radio was first invented.
                 Before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established, there was no regulations on radio and the airwaves were 
                 filled with hobbyists experimenting with the new technology. When the FCC created the radio band use plan, they allocated space for amateur operators. 
                 Today, anyone can take an exam to become licensed to transmit on the ham radio bands. I have wanted to get my license for a while, and I thought that SSP 
                 would be the perfect time to do it. I studied for my test for the first part of SSP, and after I got my license, I began constructing a Yagi antenna.
