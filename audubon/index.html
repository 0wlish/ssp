            <p>To fulfill the Community Engagement pillar of my SSP, I volunteered at the Habitat Education Center & Wildlife Sanctuary, which is part of Mass Audubon. 
                My duties included trailwork, managing invasives, and working with the goats.

            <h2>Invasive Plant Management</h2>
            <p>Invasive plants damage local ecosystems by crowding out native plants, which distrupts food chains.
                At Habitat, I helped keep these species at bay through weeding. However, non-native does not equal invasive! There were 
                plenty of non-native plants that we did not pull because they weren't harming the ecosystem. Here is a collection of a few plants, 
                native and non-native, that I encountered on this internship.

                        point downwards. You can imagine that it makes pulling this thing out that much more difficult.

                    <p>Native to the US. A climbing vine with leaves in distinctive groups of three. The leaves, stem, and roots of this plant is coated with urushiol, which causes a 
                        rash upon contact with skin. However, the goats think it is delicious. Since this plant is native, Habitat doesn't control it unless it is directly on a trail.
