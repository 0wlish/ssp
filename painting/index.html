                I have been taking art classes since my freshman year, and I wanted to continue painting in SSP. 
                I started my personal inquiry, which is a series of paintings exploring a concept or question, in March, 
                and I continued it in SSP. Boston has a lot of native wildlife, and I wanted to depict that wildlife in 
                environments that would be familiar to Bostonians. I challenged myself to work on a large canvas, and I ended 
                up working on that painting for the entirety of SSP. I plan to continue this series over the summer.

                This painting, titled "The Encounter," shows a coyote crossing a street in a suburban neighborhood at dusk. 
                I respect coyotes because of their adaptability, and I appreciate the part they play in our ecosystem. They're 
                often demonized for attacking pets, but they also help keep rabbit populations low, which helps native plants 
                thrive. I wanted to show that these tenacious creatures are vital parts of the suburban ecosystem.
