            <p>Hello! I'm Victoria Nassikas, and I'm currently a senior at BB&N. This 
                website catalogues my SSP project.

            <h1>Letter to the Class of 2026</h1>
            <p>Dear future senior at BB&N,</p>
            <p>I dedicated a lot of my SSP to learning about things I've always wanted to learn about 
                but I've never had the time for. When I was volunteering at Audubon, I learned which 
                plants were native and which were invasive, how to identify them, and how the manage the 
                invasive plants. I also got my ham radio license, something I've been considering since 
                sophomore year. I continued Computer Science because I wanted to keep learning about 
                how a compiler works, and I continued Physics because I thought it would help me study 
                for my ham radio license. Unlike most of my classmates, I still had homework. However, 
                I was spending less time at school and more time at home when I had free time. In the 
                past, I did most of my homework at school during my free block. Now that I was in SSP, 
                I found that I had more time but I was doing less work. Something I learned about 
                myself is that I need a designated work space, otherwise it's more difficult to get 
                work done. At BB&N, the quiet room had been my work space, but at home, I hadn't built 
                up the habit of doing work at my desk.</p>
            <p>One of the most important things about SSP is how you plan it, and I am really happy 
                with how I planned my SSP. The one thing I regret is waiting too long to get my license. 
                I passed my test on April 23rd, which was the fourth week of SSP. This left me only four 
                more weeks to experiment with my new radio privileges. I could have taken it sooner, 
                but I wasn't sure if I knew enough. In retrospect, I could have taken it after only two 
                weeks of studying, which would have given me more time to do more interesting activities. 
                After I got my license, I started joining weekly talk nets and I started to build my own 
                antenna. One of the things I really wanted to do was receive a signal from the ISS, which 
                occasionally broadcasts messages on the ham radio frequencies. I wish I could have just 
                gone for it and received my license in the first few weeks of SSP.</p>
            <p>Getting my ham radio license helped me gain a new appreciation for the invisible radio 
                signals that permeate our day-to-day lives. Ham radio only takes up a small portion of 
                the radio spectrum. Cell phones, WiFi, Bluetooth, ID cards, car keys, at heart they all 
                use radio. I also gained confidence in talking to new people. Before I got my license, I 
                started to attend meetings of the Boston Amateur Radio Club (BARC). I was nervous because 
                I didn't know anybody in the club. My parents kept warning me to watch out for “creepy 
                old men who frequent those sorts of places,” which didn't help my anxiety. What I found 
                in that meeting was a close-knit group of people (who were not all old men!) who were 
                welcoming to anybody interested in the hobby. They congratulated me after I got my 
                license and helped me troubleshoot and tune the antenna I was building. Once I passed my 
                test, I began to join club nets held on repeaters. These nets were nothing more than 
                sharing a quick comment about how your week was going, but through these quick chats I 
                began to feel like part of the ham community. My new experience taught me how rewarding 
                it is to put yourself out there and meet new people.</p>
            <p>I also really enjoyed volunteering at Mass Audubon Habitat, and I would recommend that 
                to any future BB&N senior looking to complete the community service pillar. The work I 
                was doing (weeding, planting, transplanting, goat care) was basically yard work, but I 
                had a lot of fun. I learned how to identify plants and which plants were invasive, as 
                well as what Audubon was doing to combat those aggressive species. Another one of my 
                responsibilities was taking the goats out on their browsing walks. Habitat keeps goats 
                to help manage invasive plants, and every so often some volunteers and I would go out to 
                weed with the goats. Getting to know the individual goats was so rewarding, and I'm glad 
                that I had that experience.</p>
            <p>My biggest piece of advice is to be ready for things to not go to plan. Sometimes things 
                don't turn out exactly how you expected, and that's okay. I had to learn this for myself 
                when I got a flat tire at Deer Island after spending a few hours birdwatching there. Now 
                the flat tire wouldn't have been an issue, but I didn't have a spare. So instead of just 
                changing the tire, we had to call AAA and wait for them to send a flatbed truck for a 
                tow. To add to the confusion, we didn't have an address beyond “we're in a parking lot 
                on Deer Island.” After some back-and-forth with the AAA dispatcher on the phone, we were 
                able to tell him some landmarks around us and he was able to send the truck. I didn't 
                have a credit card on me, so I had to convince the driver to accept payment from my dad 
                at the end of the tow, which was against company policy. The closest Sullivan Tire was 
                seven miles away, but it wasn't seven easy miles. We had to make several detours to 
                avoid Storrow Drive because the truck wouldn't be able to fit under the bridge. Finally 
                we arrived at the garage, met my dad, and left for home, a full three hours after we 
                expected to be back. </p>
            <p>Senior year is a time of planning, from what you're going to do in SSP to what college 
                you're going to go to. You may not be able to control what's happening around you, but 
                you can control your reaction to it. If your first reaction to a setback is to shutdown 
                and ignore it, then you won't get anywhere. What's important is to adapt and find a 
                solution.</p>
            <p>I consider SSP to be the best part of my high school experience, and I hope that 
                you will see it the same way.</p>
